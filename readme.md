# Express Mongoose API Generator

This is a stupid simple express api generator where all RESTful endpoints are
generated by the mongoose models found in the `models` folder.  Just drop in
your Mongoose models, and BAM, CRUD endpoints for your model.

In the models folder there are a few test models.  To get up and running, simply

`$ git clone https://github.com/ggoforth/express-mongoose-api-generator.git`
`$ cd express-mongoose-api-generator && npm install`

Then create a `.env` file with `MONGO_URL=your_mongo_connection_string`.
Finally, run:

`$ npm run dev`

NOTE: PM2 is used to run the application, so make sure you have that globally
installed first.

Then using postman, or whatever, try `POST http://localhost:3000/api/lunch`
posting to the lunch endpoint the fields found in the schema.  Then do a `GET`
request to the same endpoint and you should see the new lunch you just created.
